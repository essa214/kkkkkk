              <h4 class="text-center my-3">Luxor temple</h4>
              <p class="ps-3">The ancient Egyptians called the Luxor Temple the name "Abet Reset", meaning "the southern sanctuary", because of its location within ancient Thebes (now Luxor). The temple is located about three kilometers to the south of the Karnak Temple, which was once linked by a path bounded on both sides by statues of the Sphinx and the ram-headed Sphinx. The oldest evidence of this temple dates back to the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550-1295 BC).The Luxor Temple was not like most other ancient Egyptian temples on an east-west axis, but it was directed towards Karnak. Their temples at Karnak in solemn procession to the Luxor Temple so that they can visit the residing deity there, Amun im-Opet, a celebration known as the Feast of the Opet.</p>
              <p class="ps-3">The Luxor Temple was not built by one king. The oldest building in it was a cabin dating back to the reign of Queen Hatshepsut (about 1473-1458 BC), while the heart of the temple was built during the reign of Amenhotep III (about 1390-1353 BC). One of the inner chambers contains a group of scenes known as scenes of divine birth, as it tells us the story of the king's lineage to the god Amun-Ra himself. The heart of the temple is preceded by a colonnaded hall, in front of which is a courtyard surrounded by columns. Amenhotep III also made the corridor of the cylinders, which consists of two rows, each row containing seven cylinders. It was decorated with scenes of the Opet Festival, which were completed during the reign of King Tutankhamun (about 1336-1327 BC) and Horemheb (about 1323-1295 BC).</p>

              <h4 class="text-center my-3">Deir el-Bahari Temple</h4>
              <p class="ps-3">The site of Deir el-Bahari was famous for containing the mortuary temple of Queen Hatshepsut (about 1473-1458 BC) on the western mainland of Luxor. The temple consists of three graded layers in the valley, where the funeral rites of Queen Hatshepsut, in addition to her father, King Thutmose I, were held, as they were offered in offerings in order to guarantee the queen’s soul eternal life in the afterlife.The site of Deir el-Bahari carried a measure of holiness because it was associated with the deity Hathor, who patronized the kings of Egypt, led by the deity Horus, the first and legendary ruler of Egypt. It was believed that the embodiment of that deity was in the same hills whose shadow falls on the Temple of Hatshepsut, and on the other side of it where the tombs of some of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt in the modern state are located in the Valley of the Kings. We see the paintings that bear the prayers of Hathor in the form of a cow emerging from these mountains, whose top appears in the form of a pyramid.</p>
              <p class="ps-3">Another king, Hatshepsut, preceded the establishment of his mortuary temple in that important area by about 600 years, and he is King Mentuhotep Nebhepetre (about 2055-2004 BC) from the Middle Kingdom, where he built his temple in a stepped form, from which Queen Hatshepsut borrowed the design of her temple.</p>

              <p class="ps-3">This site for the burial of kings was carefully chosen; Where it is located on the western bank of the Nile, because the sun god descends (dies) on the western horizon in order to be reborn, and his youth is renewed on the eastern horizon, and for this reason the West was associated with funerary concepts and most of the ancient Egyptian tombs were generally located on the western bank of the Nile for this the reason.

                The powerful kings of the New Kingdom are buried under the top of a pyramidal cliff that surrounds the valley. The choice of the valley to carve the royal tombs was not by chance, as the pyramid was a symbol of resurrection and eternal life, and the pyramidal shape was considered a sign of deities. This region and the summit itself were under the control of the goddess Hathor: "the Lady of the West."</p>
